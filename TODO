 Calcurse TODO list :
 --------------------

Here are listed the modifications I will perform on Calcurse in future
releases. They are ordered into three different parts, depending on the
priority. Feel free to send me an email (see the AUTHORS file) if you
would like to see a feature added in Calcurse which does not appear in
this list.

  o  Add import capabilities to read ical files inside calcurse
  o  Create external calendars which would contain hollydays and such (in ics
     format)
  o  Add a week view in the calendar panel
  o  Add support for UTF-8
 

Average
-------
  o  Improve the '-d' option by adding more date formats
  o  Make keys user configurable
  o  Add searching capabilities with support for regex


Low
