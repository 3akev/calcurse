 Calcurse TODO list :
 --------------------

Here are listed the modifications I will perform on Calcurse in future
releases. They are ordered into three different parts, depending on the
priority. Feel free to send me an email (see the AUTHORS file) if you
would like to see a feature added in Calcurse which does not appear in
this list.

  o  Create external calendars which would contain hollydays and such (in ics
     format)

  o  Add ability to edit items, and to store multiple-lines descriptions
 

Average
