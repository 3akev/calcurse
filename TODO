 Calcurse TODO list :
 --------------------

Here are listed the modifications I will perform on Calcurse in future
releases. They are ordered into three different parts, depending on the
priority. Feel free to send me an email (see the AUTHORS file) if you
would like to see a feature added in Calcurse which does not appear in
this list.


High
----
  o  Add a week view in the calendar panel
  o  Add a clock to show current time and date with an alarm 
  o  Add export capabilities to create xml files 
  o  Add ability to edit items, and to store multiple-lines descriptions
 

Average
-------
  o  Improve the '-d' option by adding more date formats
  o  Add import capabilities to read ical files inside calcurse
  o  Accept dates entered in other formats such as d/m/yyyy or d/m/yy,
     make the date format user configurable
  o  Add shortcuts which would apply everywhere (for exemple A to add an
     appointment even if you are in the calendar panel)
  o  Make keys user configurable


Low
---
  o  Add 't' alias for 'g - Enter'
  o  Create external calendars which would contain hollydays and such (in ics
     format, as in mozilla sunbird)..
  o  All status bars should be terminal-size dependant (config_bar is not)
  o  Improve check_event_time() using sscanf as in goto_day()
  o  Get rid of the scroller() function
