 Calcurse TODO list :
 --------------------

Here are listed the modifications I will perform on Calcurse in future
releases. They are ordered into three different parts, depending on the
priority. Feel free to send me an email (see the AUTHORS file) if you
would like to see a feature added in Calcurse which does not appear in
this list.
