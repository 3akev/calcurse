 Calcurse TODO list :
 --------------------

Here are listed the modifications I will perform on Calcurse in future
releases. They are ordered into three different parts, depending on the
priority. Feel free to send me an email (see the AUTHORS file) if you
would like to see a feature added in Calcurse which does not appear in
this list.

  *  Add support for UTF-8
  *  Implement the send-item functionality to export a single item and pipe it
     to an external process

     panel
  *  Add an optional argument to the --next flag to check for next appointment
     starting from the specified time
  *  improve the way one can specify a duration (allowing something like
     XXdXXhXXmXXs)


Average

  *  Add support for CalDAV protocol (rfc4791)
