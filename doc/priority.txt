Priority
========

Change the priority of the currently selected item in the TODO list.
Priorities are represented by the number appearing in front of the
todo description. This number goes from 9 for the lowest priority to
1 for the highest priority.
Todo having higher priorities are placed first (at the top) inside the
todo panel.

If you want to raise the priority of a todo item, you need to press '+'.
In doing so, the number in front of this item will decrease, meaning its
priority increases. The item position inside the todo panel may change,
depending on the priority of the items above it.

At the opposite, to lower a todo priority, press '-'. The todo position
may also change depending on the priority of the items below.
