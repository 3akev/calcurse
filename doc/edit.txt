Edit Item
=========

Edit the item which is currently selected.

Depending on the item type (appointment, event, or todo), and if it is repeated
or not, you will be asked to choose one of the item properties to modify. An
item property is one of the following: the start time, the end time, the
description, or the item repetition.

Once you have chosen the property you want to modify, you will be shown its
actual value, and you will be able to change it as you like.

Notes
-----

* If you choose to edit the item repetition properties, you will be asked to
  re-enter all of the repetition characteristics (repetition type, frequence,
  and ending date). Moreover, the previous data concerning the deleted
  occurences will be lost.

* Do not forget to save the calendar data to retrieve the modified properties
  next time you launch Calcurse.
