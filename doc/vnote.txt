ViewNote
========

View a note which was previously attached to an item (an item which
owns a note has a '>' sign in front of it).
This command only permits to view the note, not to edit it (to do so,
use the 'EditNote' command, by pressing the 'n' key).
Once you highlighted an item with a note attached to it, and the '>' key
was pressed, you will be driven to an external pager to view that note.
The default pager is chosen the following way:
     o if the 'PAGER' environment variable is set, then this will be
       the default viewer to be called.
     o if the above environment variable is not set, then
       '/usr/bin/less' will be used.
As for editing a note, quit the pager and you will be driven back to
Calcurse.
