Synopsis
--------

[verse]
*calcurse* [*-h*|*-v*] [*-N*] [*-an*] [*-t*[num]] [*-c*<file> | *-D*<dir>]
         [*-i*<file>] [*-x*[format]] [*-d* <date>|<num>]
         [*-s*[date]] [*-r*[range]] [*-S* <regex>] [*--status*]

Description
-----------

Calcurse is a text-based calendar and scheduling application. It helps keeping
track of events, appointments and everyday tasks.  A configurable notification
system reminds user of upcoming deadlines, and the curses based interface can
be customized to suit user needs.  All of the commands are documented within an
online help system.  

Options
-------

The following options are supported:

*-a*, *--appointment*::
  Print the appointments and events for the current day and exit. 'Note:' The calendar
  from which to read the  appointments can be specified using the *-c* flag.

*-c* <file>, *--calendar* <file>::
  Specify the calendar file to use.  The default  calendar is
  *~/.calcurse/apts* (see section 'FILES' below). This option is incompatible
  with -*D*.

*-d* <date|num>, *--day* <date|num>::
  Print the appointments for the given date  or  for  the given  number  of
  upcoming days, depending on the argument format. Two possible formats are
  supported:

  * a number *n*.
--
+
In the first  case,  the  appointment  list  for  the specified  date will be
returned, while in the second case the appointment list for the *n*  upcoming
days will be returned.
+
As an example, typing *calcurse -d  3*  will  display your  appointments  for
today, tomorrow, and the day after tomorrow.

  calcurse is running in background.  The process pid will also be indicated.

*-t*[num], *--todo*[=num]::
  Print the *todo* list and exit. If the optional number 'num' is given, then
  only todos having a priority equal to 'num' will be returned. The priority
  number must be between 1 (highest) and 9 (lowest). It is also possible to
  specify *0* for the priority, in which case only completed tasks will be
  shown.

*-v*, *--version*::
  Display *calcurse* version and exit.

*-x*[format], *--export*[=format]::

  selected by default.
+
'Note:' redirect standard output to export data to a file, by issuing a command
such as:
+
----
$ calcurse --export > my_data.dat
----

Format strings
--------------

Format strings are composed of printf()-style format specifiers -- ordinary
characters are copied to stdout without modification. Each specifier is
introduced by a *%* and is followed by a character which specifies the field to
print. The set of available fields depends on the item type.

Format specifiers for appointments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*s*::
  Print the start time of the appointment as UNIX time stamp
*S*::
  Print the start time of the appointment using the *hh:mm* format
*d*::
  Print the duration of the appointment in seconds
*e*::
  Print the end time of the appointment as UNIX time stamp
*E*::
  Print the end time of the appointment using the *hh:mm* format
*m*::
  Print the description of the item
*n*::
  Print the name of the note file belonging to the item
*N*::
  Print the note belonging to the item

Format specifiers for events
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*m*::
  Print the description of the item
*n*::
  Print the name of the note file belonging to the item
*N*::
  Print the note belonging to the item

Format specifiers for todo items
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*p*::
  Print the priority of the item
*m*::
  Print the description of the item
*n*::
  Print the name of the note file belonging to the item
*N*::
  Print the note belonging to the item

Examples
~~~~~~~~

*`calcurse -r7 --format-apt='- %S -> %E\n\t%m\n%N'`*::
  Print appointments and events for the next seven days. Also, print the notes
  attached to each regular appointment (simulates *-N* for appointments).

*`calcurse -r7 --format-apt=' - %m (%S to %E)\n' --format-recur-apt=' - %m (%S to %E)\n'`*::
  Print appointments and events for the next seven days and use a custom format
  for (recurrent) appointments: * - Some appointment (18:30 to 21:30)*.

*`calcurse -t --format-todo '(%p) %m\n'`*::
  List all todo items and put parenthesesâ€Šaround the priority specifiers.

Notes
-----

Calcurse interface contains three different panels (calendar, appointment list,
and todo list) on which you can perform different actions. All the possible
actions, together with their associated keystrokes, are listed on the status
bar. This status bar takes place at the bottom of the screen.

At any time, the built-in help system can be invoked by pressing the '?' key.
Once viewing the help screens, informations on a specific command can be
accessed by pressing the keystroke corresponding to that command.

Configuration
-------------

The calcurse options can be changed from the configuration menu (shown when 'C'
is hit). Five possible categories are to be chosen from : the color scheme, the
layout (the location of the three panels on the screen), notification options,
key bindings configuration menu, and more general options (such as automatic
save before quitting).  All of these options are detailed in the configuration
menu.

Files
-----

The following structure is created in your $HOME directory (or in the directory
you specified with the *-D* option), the first time calcurse is run:

----
$HOME/.calcurse/
          |___notes/
          |___conf 
          |___keys
          |___apts 
          |___todo
----

The 'notes' subdirectory contains descriptions of the notes which are attached
to appointments, events or todos. One text file is created per note, whose name
is built using mkstemp(3) and should be unique, but with no relation with the
corresponding item's description.

The 'conf' file contains the user configuration. The 'keys' file contains the
user-defined key bindings. The 'apts' file contains all of the user's
appointments and events, and the 'todo' file contains the todo list.

'Note:' if the logging of calcurse daemon activity was set in the notification
configuration menu, the extra file 'daemon.log' will appear in calcurse data
directory. This file contains logs about calcurse activity when running in
background.

Environment
-----------

This section describes the environment variables that affect how calcurse
operates. 

*VISUAL*::
  Specifies the external editor to use for writing notes.
*EDITOR*::
  If the 'VISUAL' environment variable is not set, then 'EDITOR' will be used
  as the default external editor. If none of those variables are set, then
  '/usr/bin/vi' is used instead.
*PAGER*::
  Specifies the default viewer to be used for reading notes. If this variable
  is not set, then '/usr/bin/less' is used.

Bugs
----

Incorrect highlighting of items appear when using calcurse black and white
theme together with a *$TERM* variable set to 'xterm-color'.  To fix this bug,
and as advised by Thomas E. Dickey (xterm maintainer), 'xterm-xfree86' should
be used instead of 'xterm-color' to set the *$TERM* variable:

    "The xterm-color value for $TERM is a bad choice for 
     XFree86 xterm because it is commonly used for a 
     terminfo entry which happens to not support bce. 
     Use the xterm-xfree86 entry which is distributed 
     with XFree86 xterm (or the similar one distributed 
     with ncurses)."

If you find other bugs, please send a report to bugs@calcurse.org or to one of
the authors, below.
