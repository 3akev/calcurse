Goto
====

Jump to a specific day in the calendar.

Using this command, you do not need to travel to that day using the
displacement keys inside the calendar panel.

If you hit [ENTER] without specifying any date, Calcurse checks the system
current date and you will be taken to that date.

Notice that pressing '^G', whatever panel is selected, will select current day
in the calendar.
