Delete
======

Delete an element in the TODO or Appointment list.

Depending on which panel is selected when you press the delete key, the
hilighted item of either the TODO or Appointment list will be removed from this
list.

If the item to be deleted is recurrent, you will be asked if you wish to
suppress all of the item occurences or just the one you selected.

If the general option 'confirm_delete' is set to 'YES', then you will be asked
for confirmation before deleting the selected event. Do not forget to save the
calendar data to retrieve the modifications next time you launch Calcurse.
