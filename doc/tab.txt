Tab
===

Switch between panels.
The panel currently in use has its border colorized.

Some actions are possible only if the right panel is selected.
For example, if you want to add a task in the TODO list, you need first
to press the 'TAB' key to get the TODO panel selected. Then you can
press 'a' to add your item.

Notice that at the bottom of the screen the list of possible actions
change while pressing 'TAB', so you always know what action can be
performed on the selected panel.
