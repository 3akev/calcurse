This is usefull when an event description is longer than the available
space to display it. If that is the case, the description will be
shortened and its end replaced by '...'. To be able to read the entire
description, just press 'v' and a popup window will appear, containing
the whole event.

Press any key to close the popup window and go back to the main
Calcurse screen.
