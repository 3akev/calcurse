.SH DESCRIPTION
Calcurse is a text-based calendar and scheduling application. It helps
keeping track of events, appointments and everyday tasks. 
A configurable notification system reminds user of upcoming deadlines,
and the curses based interface can be customized to suit user needs.
All of the commands are documented within an online help system.  
.SH OPTIONS
The following options are supported:
.TP
\fB-a\fP, \fB--appointment\fP
Print the appointments and events for the current day and exit. 
.br
\fINote:\fP the calendar from which to read the appointments can be specified using
the '\-c' flag. 
.TP
\fB-c\fP <file>, \fB--calendar\fP <file>
Specify the calendar file to use. The default calendar is 
.B "'~/.calcurse/apts'" 
(see section \fIFILES\fP below).
.TP
\fB-d\fP <date|num>, \fB--day\fP <date|num>
Print the appointments and events for the given date or for

and events for today, tomorrow, and the day after tomorrow.

appointments can be specified using the '\-c' flag.

the '\-c' flag.
.TP
\fB-t\fP[num], \fB--todo\fP[=num]

then only todos having a priority equal to \fInum\fP will be returned.

by issuing a command such as: 
.br
.B    $ calcurse --export > my_data.ics
.SH NOTES
Calcurse interface contains three different panels (calendar,
appointment list, and todo list) on which you can perform different
actions. All the possible actions, together with their associated
keystrokes, are listed on the status bar. This status bar
takes place at the bottom of the screen.
.PP
At any time, the built-in help system can be invoked by pressing the '?'
key. Once viewing the help screens, informations on a specific command
can be accessed by pressing the keystroke corresponding to that command.
.SH CONFIGURATION
The calcurse options can be changed from the configuration menu (shown
when 'C' is hit). Four possible categories are to be chosen from : the
color scheme, the layout (the location of the three panels on the
screen), notification options, and more general options (such as automatic 
save before quitting). 
All of these options are detailed in the configuration menu.
.SH FILES
The following structure is created in your $HOME directory the first
time calcurse is run :
.PP
.HP 10
$HOME/.calcurse/
.br
|___notes/
.br
|___conf 
.br
|___apts 
.br
|___todo
.PP
The \fInotes\fP subdirectory contains descriptions of the notes 
which are attached to appointments, events or todos. One text file is
created per note, whose name is built using mkstemp(3) and should be
unique, but with no relation with the corresponding item's description.
.br
The \fIconf\fP file contains the user configuration. The \fIapts\fP 
file contains all of the user's appointments and events, and the 
\fItodo\fP file contains the todo list.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
This section describes the environment variables that affect how
calcurse operates. 
.TP 4
\fBVISUAL\fP 
Specifies the external editor to use for writing notes.
.TP 4
\fBEDITOR\fP
If the \fIVISUAL\fP environment variable is not set, then \fIEDITOR\fP 
will be used as the default external editor. If none of those variables
are set, then \fI/usr/bin/vi\fP is used instead.
.TP 4
\fBPAGER\fP
Specifies the default viewer to be used for reading notes. If this variable
is not set, then \fI/usr/bin/less\fP is used.
.SH BUGS
Incorrect highlighting of items appear when using calcurse black and
white theme together with a \fB$TERM\fP variable set to
\fIxterm-color\fP. 
To fix this bug, and as advised by Thomas E. Dickey (xterm maintainer),
\fIxterm-xfree86\fP should be used instead of \fIxterm-color\fP to set 
the \fB$TERM\fP variable:
    "The xterm-color value for $TERM is a bad choice for 
     XFree86 xterm because it is commonly used for a 
     terminfo entry which happens to not support bce. 
     Use the xterm-xfree86 entry which is distributed 
     with XFree86 xterm (or the similar one distributed 
     with ncurses)."
